    title: The Tempranillo That Could
    content: "A little over two years in large format French Oak barrels and another 8 months months in bottle, allows our single vineyard Tempranillo to exhibit bright aromas and flavors of pomegranate, plum, dark cherry, herbs & boysenberry jam. These lead into hints of dark chocolate, sweet blonde tobacco and dusty/earthy aromas and flavors. The well balanced acidity and ripe/mature tannins, help round out this 100% varietal Tempranillo. Our Tempranillo pairs well with Spanish Chilindron stew, a  rack of lamb or any dishes incorporating rosemary and thyme."
blurb: "A unique wine, rich and deep in color and complimented with lingering notes of black cherry, tobacco, and cassis."
